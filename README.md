Mystery Digits

Welcome to Mystery Digits, a fun and casual mind game! Your goal is to uncover unknown digits and decorate the main menu.


How To Play:

•	The game has levels that progressively get harder. Your task is to guess the digits.

•	To make a guess, drag number cards onto the board. Alternatively, click a card to select it, then click your preferred spot on the board.

•	Clicking a card reveals helper buttons. Digit buttons help you know where a card can or cannot be placed. Probability buttons indicate the likelihood that the selected card is an unknown digit. Green button means certain existence, yellow(default) button means probable existence, red button means non-existence.

•	When the board is filled, press the check button to see your guess and the result. A check icon shows correct digits in the right place, while a two-headed arrow indicates correct digits in the wrong position.

•	Keep an eye on the life bar. Each wrong guess reduces it. If you guess right, you gain stars. If the bar empties, the level is failed.


Winning the Game:

•	Upon winning, a level success popup appears. A circle progress bar fills with stars. Complete it to earn a wild card, revealing the right number in a specific place on the next level.


Main Menu:

•	Select a planet you've traveled or continue on interrupted one. Unplayed planets are locked.

•	Mystery digits are randomly generated after each completed or unplayed level.

•	Travel with your spaceship in the space.
